# Smart Mobility Engineering Week 14
For Smart Mobility Engineering course.
In this week, I trained the model with convolutional neural networks  followed by MaxPooling and Dense layers. 
As we do not have much classes and 
the images are enormously different we got over 95 % accuracy. There is no overfitting or underfitting problem occured. 
The accuracy for test data and train data are almost the same.It only took 16, 32, 64 dense 
layers. The training time was only 4 or 5 minutes to get max accuracy. 
The next step is connecting the cnn model to camera with openCV. So I will configure
the camera and enable the edges and widths for a yellov rectangle which detects the
object in the camera. I have almost finished the code, the testing left only. 
  I hope it will not be problem for the embedded systems to detect images as the model 
does not have much parameters.

The embaded system is not ready yet. So I could not test it. But the testing will be easy. 
I use only If else statement and make it happen so. I the output we get from the demo, the motor 
has to do certain action accordingly. It is the next thing I do.
